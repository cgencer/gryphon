Currently It supports Github and Bitbucket based deployments. \n\n<b>Great for NodeJS project but designed to be work with any project</b>\n\nScreencast\n----------\n<a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNptRGFAPkM'>\n\t<img src='https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-zkEgabCO1P4/TpuXvP1CcnI/AAAAAAAAAfE/i4Mb4EXMLfM/s144/youtube.jpg' />\n</a>\n\nHow It Works\n------------\n\n* Install Nariya on your Server\n* First you add your Github based project to Nariya (its very easy)\n* You'll get an unique web url \n* Then you've to configure above as an Github Service Hook (webhook)\n* After that when you did a commit following happens\n* Nariya will get the updated codebase to the server from github\n* Then if it is an NodeJS project it will `npm install`\n* After if your projet folder has `pre.sh` file it will be executed\n* Then If your node project has `start*.js` file Nariya will start that script with forever eg:- `start-app.js`, `startApp.js`\n* Then it will look for `post.sh` and execute if exists\n* You will get an email notification once this completed (look for configurations)\n\nInstall\n-------\n\n\tsudo npm install forever -g\n\tsudo npm install nariya -g\n\nUsage\n-------\n\n* Start the Server - `nariya start`\n* Visit your github based project and add it - `nariya add <project name>`\n* You'll be shown an url\n* Then add the url you generated as an Github Service Hook<br>\n\teg:- https://github.com/arunoda/nariya/admin/hooks\n* That's all. Push some commit to master branch ans see for your self\n* Add any number of projects you want\n\nConfigurations\n--------------\n\n* Nariya create an folder called `.nariya` on your home folder \n* It contains `nariya.conf` file where you can add and edit project\n* Also it contains log files for both nariya it self and projects as well\n* In order work email notification correctly. You've to edit the `nariya.conf`\n* Most of the configurations for the app is auto generated when adding. You can config via `nariya.conf`. Such as custom logpath, branch to get pulls\n\n",
